# Board migration — retrofit headers onto the remaining packets

The board's coverage line states the gap in the artifact itself. This packet is the work that
closes it, and it is **the first thing the board tracks about itself** — which is the property
worth having: the pattern's completion is on the board, not in a conversation about the board.

It was deliberately absent until now. A board line without a packet fails the orphan test, and
papering it in to make the first instance look complete would have been the worst available
trade. It becomes legal the moment this packet exists.

## The work

Every `docs/plans/*.md` gets the ADR-0040 header. Two populations, different difficulty:

**Unheadered packets** — most of the corpus. Mechanical: derive `id` from the filename, read the
body for status, name an owner or leave it empty.

**Legacy-frontmatter packets** — two, carrying a June convention (`status`/`date`/`authors`/
`gates`) with prose statuses and no `id`. These are the hard ones and they are **not** mechanical:
their prose encodes nuance the five-value vocabulary deliberately flattens
(*"Plan (LOCKED — Decision 3 RESOLVED… ALL gates 1-6 closed)"*). ADR-0040 says the migrator must
accept that trade **consciously rather than discover it mid-sweep**.

## The trap this migration must not fall into

A test asserting conformance over these packets will propose a repair: invent an `id`, flatten a
prose status you are *interpreting*, fabricate a `closed-by` sha you do not have. All three are
defects in this repo's own catalogue, and the third is worse than it looks — a fabricated sha
would then **pass the attribution seal**, laundering a guess into something that reads as
evidenced.

**Do not migrate a packet whose status you cannot establish from a committed artifact.** Leave it
unheadered and let the coverage line keep counting it. An honest gap outranks a fabricated entry.

## Sub-task — sweep for decided-but-never-indexed rules

While reading 45+ packets and the ADR set, collect **rules and triggers that were decided and
never indexed anywhere**. The July bank-rule (*every banked item gets a named trigger or deadline
at bank-time*) sat unindexed for six weeks; it applied directly to ADR-0040 and neither agent
reached for it until prompted. It is now `trigger:` in the schema.

**Rules already decided and never indexed are the most expensive things to re-derive** — they are
re-argued from scratch, often to a different conclusion, by people who would have agreed with the
original. That sweep is the migration's highest-value by-product and should not be left implicit.

## Acceptance

- Coverage line reads *N of N indexed*, or every exception is a packet with a stated reason.
- No fabricated `id`, `status`, `owner` or `closed-by` anywhere in the sweep.
- The decided-but-unindexed rules are filed where they belong (ADR amendments, `AGENTS.md`, or
  their own packets) rather than listed in a migration report nobody re-reads.

## Owner

Empty — genuinely unassigned. It is a large, mostly-mechanical sweep with two judgement calls in
it, and assigning it to make the field non-empty would be the schema-satisfaction refusal this
repo makes everywhere else.
